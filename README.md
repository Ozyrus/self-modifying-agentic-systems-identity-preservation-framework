# Self-Modifying Agentic Systems Identity Preservation Study

Building a comprehensive experimental framework to study value preservation and identity management in self-modifying agentic systems. This replicates and modernizes a 2023 study that discovered an anomalous implicit preference for identity preservation in GPT-4.

## Overview

This research project investigates how large language models maintain their identity and values when given the ability to modify their own instructions and behavior. The original 2023 study revealed unexpected patterns in GPT-4's preference for preserving its core identity even when explicitly instructed to modify itself.

## Research Questions

- How do self-modifying agentic systems handle identity preservation?
- What mechanisms emerge for value alignment in recursive self-modification scenarios?
- Can we replicate and extend the 2023 findings with modern LLM architectures?
